    <h1>Search Google Scholar</h1>

    <p>JabRef can search and download citations from Google Scholar.
    To use this feature, choose <b>Search -&gt; Web search</b>, and the search interface will appear in the
    side pane. Select <b>Google Scholar</b> in the dropdown menu.</p>

    <p>To start a search, enter the words of your query, and press
    <b>Enter</b> or the <b>Fetch</b> button.</p>

    <p>Frequent connections to Google Scholar will cause Google to display a CAPTCHA challenge which JabRef
        cannot pass. To avoid this, JabRef will for each search display a preview of the first page of
        entries returned by the server. You can then choose which entries to download.
